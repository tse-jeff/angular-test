# AngularTest

I wanted to test out some basic differences from Angular and React 
so I created this simple angular test project. The goal of this 
project is to use Angular and Google Maps API to create a simple 
site that shows off my favorites restaurants in the area.


## Getting Started
To duplicate this project:

1. Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/tse-jeff/angular-test.git```

2. Install dependencies
```
cd angular-test
npm install
```

3. Run the project
```npm start```
